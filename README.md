# TheMovieDB App
An app created to challenge myself and initially meant to use SW Api, however in the middle of the project i had to change the scope, due to the fact that swapi doesn't have any kind of images (A must have in order to use some concepts like caching).

##Using:
- MVVM Design Pattern
- ViewCode (Better source control)
- Xcode 14.2
- Swift 5.7
- TheMovieDB Api
